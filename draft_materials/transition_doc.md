# Purpose and scope.
Trade reconciliation is a critical process in financial operations, aimed at ensuring that trade data from various systems align and discrepancies are identified and resolved. This document outlines the methodology for reconciling trades transferred from the Kronos system to the Orca system. A key objective of this reconciliation effort is to monitor various risk metrics associated with the trades, thereby enhancing data integrity and reducing the potential for financial reporting errors. By systematically comparing records from Kronos and Orca, we will establish a robust framework that supports effective risk management and promotes transparency in our trade operations. This guide will detail the procedures, tools, and best practices employed in this essential function.
